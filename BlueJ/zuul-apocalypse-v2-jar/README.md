# zuul-apocalypse-v2
This is a version of the "zuul-apocalypse-v2" text-based game, but with the three packages "client", "common", and "implementation" replaced with corresponding jar files in the directory "libs". The original game was created for the 6th lab of the course Software Construction 2 (WiSe2020). <br> Like the 1st version, this is also a collaborative project with one other team member, Mo Elghamrawy.
> The "zuul-apocalypse-v1" project can be found here: https://github.com/Yuriel849/Java/tree/master/BlueJ/zuul-apocalypse-v1.

<br>
To start the game, call the static method "main" in the Game class. <br>
Note: The original version of this project is "zuul-better" by Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes, version 2016.02.29.
