# zuul-apocalypse-v2
This is a refactored custom version of the "zuul-apocalypse-v1" text-based game, incorporating packages and a text and image-based GUI for the 6th lab of the course Software Construction 2 (WiSe2020). <br> Like the 1st version, this is also a collaborative project with one other team member, Mo Elghamrawy.
> The "zuul-apocalypse-v1" project can be found here: https://github.com/Yuriel849/Java/tree/master/BlueJ/zuul-apocalypse-v1.
