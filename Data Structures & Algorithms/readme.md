### Design Patterns
A **design pattern** describes a solution to a "typical" software design problem.

Consists of...

    name (identifies the pattern);
    context (describes the scenarios to which this pattern can be applied);
    template (describes how the pattern is applied);
    result (describes what the pattern produces).

Design patterns fall into two groups,

    patterns for algorithm design problems
    and patterns for software engineering problems.

Algorithm design patterns:

    Recursion
    Amortization
    Divide-and-conquer
    Prune-and-search (a.k.a. decrease-and-conquer)
    Brute force
    The greedy method
    Dynamic programming

Software engineering design patterns:

    Template method
    Composition
    Adapter
    Position
    Iterator
    Factory method
    Comparator
    Locator
